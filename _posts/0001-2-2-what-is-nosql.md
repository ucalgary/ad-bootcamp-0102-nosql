* early interpretation was “not SQL”, but current uses generally mean “not only SQL” or “not relational”
* “not relational” is the most accurate interpretation at the moment, as some NoSQL databases actually do offer SQL-like interfaces
* the goal is not to reject SQL, but to consider the limitations of relational databases in capturing and describing the vast amount of information in the modern web
